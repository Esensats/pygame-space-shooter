Notes: /src/lib folder is required, don't gitignore it

## Installation guide

First clone the project into desired directory using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Esensats/pygame-space-shooter.git
```

Make sure you have `Python` installed. The interpreter used while developing was of version `3.9.12`, but newer ones will most likely work as well.

Then you have to use install required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **_NOTE:_** if pip results in an error, you can try using one of the following commands:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> if nothing works, you should check if your Python is installed correctly, and add `pip` to path.

To launch the game you have to launch `src/main.py`. You can use `.vscode/launch.json` if you use VSCode.
